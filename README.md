# Classification

This repository consist of all the classification projects I've performed.   

1. SVM Regression: This script uses Logistic Regression to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                        buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                        - SVM.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                        - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.

1. Naive Bayes Regression: This script uses Naive Bayes Regression to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                            buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                            - Naive_Bayes.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                            - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.

1. Kernel SVM Regression: This script uses Kernel_SVM Regression to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                        buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                        - Kernel_SVM.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                        - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.

1. KNN Regression: This script uses KNN Regression to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                        buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                        - K_NN.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                        - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.

1. Logistic_Regression: This script uses Logistic Regression to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                        buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                        - Logistic_Regression.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                        - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.
