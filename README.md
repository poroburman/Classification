# Classification

This repository consist of all the classification projects I've performed.   

1. Artificial Neural Network: This script uses ANN to analyze and predicts which customers continue to keep their accounts within a specific bank and which customers                      leave the bank.The dataset contains the details of all the customers within a bank. Following files are part of this project:    
                        - ANN - Classification
                        - Churn_Modelling.csv : dataset.   

1. Random Forest: This script uses Random Forest Classification to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                        buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                        - Random_Forest_Classification.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                        - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.

1. Decision Tree: This script uses Decisioon Tree Classification to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                        buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                        - Decision Tree.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                        - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.

1. SVM Classification: This script uses SVM classification to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                        buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                        - SVM.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                        - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.

1. Naive Bayes Classification: This script uses Naive Bayes Classification to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                              buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                              - Naive_Bayes.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                              - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.

1. Kernel SVM Classificatioon: This script uses Kernel_SVM Classification to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                                buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                                - Kernel_SVM.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                                - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.

1. KNN Classification: This script uses KNN Classification to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                        buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                        - K_NN.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                        - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.

1. Logistic_Regression: This script uses Logistic Regression to find out if based upon their Age and Estimated Salary, can we predict if a customer 
                        buys a product or not. The dataset used here is 'Social_Network_Ads'. This project consists of the following files:    
                        - Logistic_Regression.ipynb: python script for this project.   
                        - Network_Ads.csv: dataset for this project.
